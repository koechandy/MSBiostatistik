Data Visualization
==================

We require plots, charts and other statistical graphics for the written communication of quantitative ideas.

They allow us to more easily convey relationships and reveal deviations from patterns.

Gelman and Unwin 2011:

> A well-designed graph can display more information than a table of the same size, and more information than numbers embedded in text. Graphical displays allow and encourage direct visual comparisons.

Presenter Notes
===============

The field of data visualization is relatively immature, but growing.

---

Interdisciplinary
=================

---

Data Dimensions
===============

There is a limit to the number of dimensions that can be simultaneously perceived

* not all dimensions, data, equally important or interesting
* appropriate choice depends on message and audience

Encoding Information
====================

Creator of visuzlization has a message that is derived from their interpretation of data, which is **encoded** in a graphic.

Reader must **decode** it from graphic and develop an interpretation of its message.

![viz flow](images/viz5.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

does not know the creator’s exact interpretation
is reader’s interpretation consistent with creator’s? with the data?

Graphic Choices

Graphic Choices
===============

![increasing work force](images/viz6b.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

graphic choices make a difference
- including zero produces illusion of stability

---

Graphic Choices
===============

![similar survival](images/viz7a.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

including zero often the default

---

Graphic Choices
===============

![different survival](images/viz7b.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

include range relevant to the problem

---

Scale Matters
=============

![life insurance](images/viz8a.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

Changes on the logarithmic scale can be interpreted as proportional changes

---

Scale Matters
=============

![cpi](images/viz8b.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

Use same scale for both axes

---

Chartjunk
=========

![chartjunk](images/viz9.png)

*Chartjunk* refers to all visual elements in charts and graphs that are not necessary to comprehend the information represented on the graph, or that distract the viewer from this information

---

Chartjunk
=========

Coined by Edward Tufte in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*.

> The interior decoration of graphics generates a lot of ink that does not tell the viewer anything new. The purpose of decoration varies — to make the graphic appear more scientific and precise, to enliven the display, to give the designer an opportunity to exercise artistic skills. Regardless of its cause, it is all non-data-ink or redundant data-ink, and it is often chartjunk.

Analogous to principles for effective writing. From *The Elements of Style*:

> “Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.”

Graphical Perception
====================

Relative ease of perception, in order of increasing difficulty:

* position along a common scale
* position along non-aligned scales
* length
* angles and slopes
* area
* volume
* color and density

Dynamite Plots
==============

Dynamite plots hide the raw data and usually show one-sided or symmetric confidence intervals.

Florence Nightengale
====================

Nurse, writer, statistician (1820-1910)

![nightengale](images/viz22a.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

shows that most soldiers died of disease than all other causes (including wounds) during Crimean war
also, death rate was higher in the first year of the war (right half)
visually appealing, dramatic; piques curiosity

---

Florence Nightengale 2.0
========================

![Gelman nightengale](images/viz22b.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

trends (and departures from trends) clearer
still, original graphic did its job (caused stir, garnered attention)

---

Tabular Visualization
=====================

![raw table](images/viz23a.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

- too dense, hard to read, impossible to compare

---

Tabular Visualization
=====================

![better table](images/viz23b.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

ordered by first column
standard error smaller
removed parentheses

---

Tabular Visualization
=====================

![graphical table](images/viz23c.png)

Presenter Notes
===============

visual aids for identifying trends, large changes
