# Bios6301 Lectures

The slide decks for Bios6301 lectures are composed in Markdown, and compiled into HTML5 slides using [Landslide](https://github.com/adamzap/landslide). Slides are built using the following syntax:

    landslide --theme=tango_new lecture1_intro.md

This builds the intro lecture slide deck into an html document called `presentation.html`. An alternate output name can be specified using the `-d` flag. See `landslide --help` for more command line options.
