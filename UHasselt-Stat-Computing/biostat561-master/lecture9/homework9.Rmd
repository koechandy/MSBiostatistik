Homework 9 due June 5, 3:15pm

No office hours Mon 3 June due to travel; special office hours Tuesday 4 June, 2:30pm

In this homework, we will continue to explore the coverage of confidence intervals for $\beta_1$ under the model $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$, contrasting confidence intervals created using model-based standard errors ($var(\hat{\beta}) = \hat{\sigma}^2 (X^TX)^{-1}$) and confidence intervals created using White's heteroskedasticity-robust "sandwich" standard errors ($var(\hat{\beta}) = (X^TX)^{-1}X^T diag(e_i^2) X(X^TX)^{-1}.$)

We will simulate from the model
$$  
\begin{aligned}
Y_i \mid X_i, u_i &= \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i, \text{ where} \\
X_i &\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0, 1), \\
u_i &\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0, 1), \text{ independent of the } X_i, \\
\epsilon_i &= f(X_i) \times u_i.
\end{aligned}
$$

# Question 1: R scripts to assess coverage from the command line

Adapt the R scripts from class to compare the coverage of 95\% confidence intervals for $\beta$ using both model-based and heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. Your script should take arguments $n$ (the sample size), $\beta$ (the true value of $\beta$ to simulate under), and `option` (which has value either `1` or `2` for the form of $f(x)$, where $f_1(x) = 1+x^2$ and $f_2(x) = 2-x^2$), `seed` (the starting seed) and `reps` (the number of replicates to use). Use the package `sandwich` to compute the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. 

Show the output of 

`Rscript qtn1_response.R n=100 beta=1 option=1 seed=123 reps=1000`

and 

`Rscript qtn1_response.R n=100 beta=1 option=2 seed=123 reps=1000`

What coverage do you find based on each method? 

How long did your scripts take to run?

<!-- Optional but recommended for 533 students: Explain why you get the results you see.  -->

<!-- Adapt the examples given in lecture to compare the coverage of confidence intervals for $\beta$ based on model-based and sandwich standard errors for the model. Fix $\beta = 1$ and compare the performance for two options for the variance of $\epsilon_i$: $f_1(x) = 1+x^2$ and $f_2(x) = 2-x^2$. Use the package  -->

<!-- a) Read through `se_ex1.R`, the script to compare the coverage of confidence intervals -->

<!-- Based on reading the script, for which parameter are we interested in the coverage? How do you know? -->

<!-- b) Open up an R session (e.g. in RStudio) and make sure that the package `sandwich` is installed on your computer. -->

<!-- c) Open up a terminal and run the command -->

<!-- `Rscript se_ex1.R B=10 seed=547 n=5 truebeta=2` -->

<!-- What coverage do you find based on each method? -->

<!-- d) Now run the script `call_ex1_once.sh` via the command line: -->

<!-- `./call_ex1_once.sh B=10 seed=547 n=5 truebeta=2` -->

<!-- What standard errors do you find for each model now? -->

<!-- # Question 2: Running R scripts on `cox` -->

<!-- Write a shell script called `qtn2.sh` that calls `qtn2_response.R`.`qtn2.sh` should be similar to `call_sim_robust_se.sh`, seen in class. `qtn2_response.R`  -->

<!-- Log on to `cox` and run -->

<!-- `./qtn2.sh n=100 beta=1 option=1 seed=123 reps=1000` -->

<!-- Approximately how long did it take? -->

<!-- You will need to change your permissions with `chmod` to execute the example from class (`call_sim_robust_se.sh`). If you run into "bad interpreter" errors, check out [stackoverflow.com/questions/2920416/configure-bin-shm-bad-interpreter](stackoverflow.com/questions/2920416/configure-bin-shm-bad-interpreter).  -->

# Question 2: Running R scripts on the clusters

Time to use the cluster! Use the examples from lecture to guide your script-writing in this question. 

We want to investigate the effect of $n$ on the coverage of the two procedures for the two data-generating mechanisms $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$. We want to run 5000 simulations per `n` and per `option`, and look at $n\in\{50, 100, 150, \ldots, 500\}$. 

Adapt your response to question 1 to write an R script that runs `reps` replicates for option 1 and 2, and all $n\in\{50, 100, 150, \ldots, 500\}$. Confirm it works for small `reps`. Call this script `qtn2_response.R`. 

Write a shell script called `call_qtn2.sh` that calls `qtn2_response.R`. `qtn2.sh` should be similar to `call_sim_robust_se.sh`, seen in class, and have arguments `sim-name`, `nreps-total` and `nreps-per-job`. 

Adapt `submit_sim_robust_se.sh` to create `run_qtn2.sh` to run your simulation study on the cluster. Check it works locally for a small simulation. 

Connect to `bayes.biostat.washington.edu` using your favourite `ssh` client (see Homework 8). Run `run_qtn2.sh` on the bayes cluster to run 5000 reps per option and $n$. Split each simulation into either 5 or 10 jobs (i.e., not 1 job and not 5000 jobs). Perform this batch submission either using a loop in your shell script, or by using a job array.

Present your results graphically and/or tabularly in a way that best illustrates your findings. Comment on what you see.

Optional but recommended for 533 students: Explain why you get the results you see.

Upload your script(s) to your github repository along with a pdf containing a write up of your results.
