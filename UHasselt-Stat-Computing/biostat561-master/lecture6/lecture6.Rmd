# Misc

- Please make sure you are effectively using `git` via the command line to submit your homework
    - Many companies, especially tech companies, manage their code bases using `git`, so make sure you actually learn how to use it!
    - Don't think that quantitative analysts are exempt!

# Feedback

Thank you everyone for their helpful feedback

  - We will do more exercises in pairs
  - Beginner vs advanced track: wonderful idea! We're going to do this today

# Today's agenda

1. One of the best R package developers I know is going to teach you about writing R packages (and making them available via git!)
2. ``Advanced track''
    - Search path
    - Environments
    - Namespaces
    - Effective package development workflow


# R packages

Why write an R package?

- The best way to contribute to science
- Allow others to build on your advances
- Promote yourself and your work
- Pass this class


$$ \text{package} = \text{code} + \text{other stuff} $$

Bryan is going to teach you about the other stuff... since you already know how to code!

# Storing objects in R

We know broadly how to create, store and overwrite objects in R

```{r}
x <- 5
x <- 7
x
```

# What happens with clashes?

What does this do?

\footnotesize
```{r, silent = TRUE}
ggplot  <- function(...) "Ha! Overwritten!"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Width))
```

Why?

# Environments

`R` has an *ordered* search path

\footnotesize

```{r}
search()
```

# Where does R search? In what order?

\footnotesize
```{r}
search()
```

- When looking for an object, R looks in the first position in `search()`, if it doesn't find it, it moves on to the second, etc.

# Search path

- Global Environment: default storage
    - First place R looks for objects
- Then moves through packages... in the order specified!

Most recently we had loaded ggplot2, so it was first.

# Packages are loaded into the second position of the search path

\footnotesize
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

Now we know how to interpret some warnings, too!

# Packages are loaded into the second position of the search path


\footnotesize
```{r}
search()
```

# Activity: 1 minute

Explain to the person next to you why we got the result we did here:

```{r, silent = TRUE}
ggplot  <- function(...) "Ha! Overwritten!"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Width))
```


# Namespaces

All packages have a `NAMESPACE` file: a collection of objects to be exported and imported

- To avoid overwriting users' variables
- To avoid ambiguity in function calls
- To ensure the package has everything it needs to run
- To encourage modular code

# What exactly is loaded?

- `library(pkg)` adds the functions in the NAMESPACE of pkg to the search path
- Your `NAMESPACE` is auto generated using roxygen *tags*
    - never directly modify your `NAMESPACE` file
    - We will come back to roxygen comments/tags later in the lecture


# The `::` operation

The operator `x::y` means "the function `y` in the namespace of package `x`"

```{r, fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
ggplot  <- function(...) "Ha! Overwritten!"
ggplot2::ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                          y = Petal.Width))
```

# Internal and external functions

As a package developer, you need to decide what the user has access to and what is for internal use.

You can access non-exported functions using `:::`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dplyr::abort_case_when_formula      # throws error
dplyr:::abort_case_when_formula
```

To *not export* a function to the NAMESPACE of a package, best practice is to just *not add* an `@export` roxygen flag


# Seeing what's available

- See where R looks for things using `search()`
- See what is available in the $n$th position of the search path using `ls(..., pos = n)`


# You can attach data frames

You can also attach data frames to the search path...

```{r}
attach(women)
search()
```

# But don't!

```{r}
height <- height*2.54
height[1:5]
women$height[1:5]
```

but don't do this!

# Attach

Moral of the story: Don't attach data frames, but it's fine to attach packages via `library(...)`

# Starting an R package

Ideally, create packages from scratch as soon as you begin on a project

- RStudio->File->New project->New Directory->R Package

![](../images/firstpackage.png){width=300px}


# Starting an R package: `DESCRIPTION`

Short-term: Keeps track of imports (dependencies)

Long-term: Help others find your package

![](../images/description.png){width=350px}

# Writing R packages: documentation

`roxygen` documentation makes everything incredibly easy

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("roxygen2")
```

# Writing R packages: documentation

Under the `Build` tab, under Build tools, check `Generate documentation with Roxygen`

![](../images/build1.png){width=400px}

# Writing R packages: documentation

1. Delete the default `NAMESPACE` file and the `man` folder
2. Write `roxygen` comments in your `.R` file
    - `roxygen` comments start with `#'`
3. `cmd/ctrl + shift + b` builds the package
4. `cmd/ctrl + shift + d` autogenerates documentation based on your roxygen comments

# Building packages

Core "other stuff" for a package

- Code: written by you, goes into `R` folder (no subdirectories allowed)
- `DESCRIPTION`: written by you
- Documentation: autogenerated by `roxygen` comments, goes into `man` folder
- `NAMESPACE`: autogenerated by `roxygen` comments

# Very important

The right way to debug/develop a function is to write a `testthat` test, and use `devtools::load_all()` + `testthat::test()`

- `devtools::load_all()` is a fast alternative to building and loading
    - Fast because it only loads what has changed

# Very important

You should not have scripts to help you debug or develop a package. Everything should be a function (exported or not) in your `R/` folder, and you should load and test the package outlined above.

Fun fact: I did this incorrectly for years... and wasted so much time trying to fix "Error: object not found" 

# Very important


The wrong way to debug/develop a function is by loading it into the Global Environment and testing it there.

Don't think that `rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))` saves you

- It removes everything in the Global Environment... but not packages!
- Loading functions into the global environment is usually accompanied by loading variables into the global environment, and packages can't access objects that are not passed to it via arguments

# Other things to keep in mind

1. `testthat` is a Hadley Wickham package to write unit tests
    - It's so easy to write tests!
    - Every error/bug should become a test
    - Manage your *TODOs* with tests
2. Datasets take a special format
    - Don't release data in the same way as functions
3. `pkgdown` easily turns your R package documentation into a website: `build_site()`


# Coming up

- Homework 6: due next *Wednesday*
    - No homework 5
    - Write an R package to do something useful!
