# This week

- Big challenge with Homework 1?
- Comments from homeworks go in README files
    * Each week, look in the repository for this (in a couple of days...)

# github and protected data

 
# A note on history

Why are permutation/resampling approaches to data analysis modern?

# Where do random numbers even come from?

- Linear congruential generators: $X_{n + 1} = (aX_n + c)$  mod $m$ 
    * Definitely not random  -- but hard to tell if you don't know $X_0, a, c, m$
    * Java's java.util.Random uses $m=2^{48}, a = 25214903917, c=11$

# Where do random numbers even come from?

-  R uses the Mersenne Twister by default
    * `?RNG` brings up some information the different options
    * Not a LCG, but has period of $2^{19937}-1$
    * Very interesting talk by Kellie Ottoboni & Philip Stark (UC Berkeley) on permutation testing

# RStudio

- You should save all of your work as scripts (`.R` files)
- Laying out your workspace effectively
    * Rstudio -> Preferences -> Pane Layout
- Running code quickly
    * With the cursor on the line of script you want to run...
         * `cmd + return` (Mac)
         * `ctrl + enter` (Windows)
- Commenting: precede comments by a `#`

# RStudio

`R` sessions are located somewhere on your computer.

\footnotesize
```{r}
getwd() # where am I?
```


Try to avoid `setwd()` calls -- use projects instead! 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("/Users/adwillis/research") # 
```

If you open a RProject (`.Rproj`) file, your working directory will be the location of that file by default

# R packages

- Most packages are distributed via CRAN, a global network for the distribution of R code
    * You may need to set your "mirror"
    * RStudio -> Preferences -> Packages
- Packages need to be installed, and then loaded

\footnotesize
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") # first download...
library(tidyverse) # ...then load
```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Avoid `require(tidyverse)`...

# tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages based on 4 principles for handling data:

1. Reuse existing data structures.
2. Compose simple functions with the pipe.
3. Embrace functional programming.
4. Design for humans.

The R project for Statistical Computing was built for a different age; the tidyverse is a collection of tools for *our* age

# tidyverse


<center>![](../images/tidypic.png){width=800px}</center>

# New data arrives!

What do you do?


# Open it!

```{r}
wgs <- read_csv("colon_cancer.csv")
```

# Open it!

`read_csv` is from the `readr` package (installed with the tidyverse)

- Much, much smarter than `read.csv` (base R)
- `read_tsv`, `read_tsv`, `read_delim`, ...
- No `read_xls`! (I use `readxl::read_xlsx` and `readxl::read_xls`)

Cannot deal with information that is not contained in cells (formatting, highlighting, etc.)

# Look at it!

\footnotesize
```{r}
wgs
```

# Look at it!

```{r}
class(wgs)
```

# Look at it!

\footnotesize
```{r}
as.data.frame(wgs)
```

# tibbles

Data frames are great! Except for

- printing them
- working with both characters and factors
- manipulating multiple columns

tibbles are the data frame alternative of the tidyverse


# tibbles

\footnotesize
```{r}
starwars
```

# tibbles

> A tibble, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don't change variable names or types, and don't do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. Tibbles also have an enhanced print method() which makes them easier to use with large datasets containing complex objects.

# How do we read code?

Translate the following code into words:

```{r}
length(unique(wgs$Patient))
```

# Intuitive coding

```{r}
wgs$Patient %>%
  unique %>%
  length
```

`%>%` is the "pipe operator"

- `f(x)` is the same as `x %>% f`
- "Take `x` and apply the function `f`"


# Analyse it

How many PA samples do I have?

```{r}
sum(wgs$`PA/NPA` == "PA") # ugh
sum(wgs$`PA/NPA` == "PA", na.rm = T)
```

How about for lots of different types?

# Analyse it

Awesome package to streamline data analysis: `dplyr`

```{r}
summarize(wgs, n())
```


# Analyse it

`dplyr` functions integrate beautifully with pipes

```{r}
wgs %>%
  summarize(n())
```

# Analyse it

Amy's favourite thing about the tidyverse:

```{r}
wgs %>%
  summarise(n())
```

Recall: where was R developed?

# Analyse it

```{r}
wgs %>%
  group_by(`PA/NPA`) %>%
  summarise(n())
```


# Intuitive coding

Using native tidyverse functions `group_by` and `summarise`/`summarize`

```{r}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(n())
```


# Intuitive coding

```{r}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(n()) %>% 
  nrow
```


# Intuitive coding

```{r}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean.mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# Writing beautiful code

The alternative:

\footnotesize
```{r}
mean_masses <- vector("numeric", length(unique(starwars$species)))
i <- 1
for (sp in unique(starwars$species)) {
  mean_masses[i] <- mean(starwars$mass[starwars$species == sp], 
                         na.rm = TRUE)
  i <- i + 1
}
data.frame(unique(starwars$species), mean_masses)
```

# More piping

Multiple summary statistics at once

```{r}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean.mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd.mass = sd(mass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(n >= 3)
```


# dplyr

*dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:*

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows

# dplyr: data manipulation

`select`: select only certain columns

```{r}
starwars %>%
  select(name, ends_with("color"))
```

# dplyr: data manipulation

`filter`: filter to certain rows

```{r}
starwars %>%
  filter(hair_color == "black",
         skin_color %in% c("fair", "light"))
```

# dplyr: data manipulation

Get summary statistics

```{r}
starwars %>%
  filter(hair_color == "black",
         skin_color %in% c("fair", "light")) %>%
  summarise("mass" = mean(mass, na.rm = T))
```

`starwars` is from the package `tibble`, `filter` is from the package `dplyr`... Hence `tidyverse`!

`%>%` is included in every `tidyverse` package

# More piping

- `x %>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)`
- `x %>% f()` is equivalent to `f(x)`
- `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`
- `x %>% f(y, .)` is equivalent to `f(y, x)`


# Advanced piping

There are actually multiple different types of pipes (not just `%>%`)

You need to load `magrittr` to use the following:

- `starwars %$% name` is `starwars[, "name"]` *as a vector*
- `x %<>% f` is equivalent to `x <- f(x)`

# Watch out!

```{r, error=TRUE}
starwars
  %>% filter(hair_color == "black",
         skin_color %in% c("fair", "light"))
  %>% summarise("mass" = mean(mass, na.rm = T))
```

# tidyverse

- Programming in R using the tidyverse will require you to unlearn some bad habits, and may be more difficult for experienced R programmers
- Learning this style will make your code more readable, debugable, and efficient
- Graduate school is the time to learn!
- All of your code should be using this syntax starting now!

**I will ask you to redo homework questions if you do not write them in the style**

# I wish...

- "...that my output didn't spew numbers when I type `my_big_data_frame`"
- "...there was a function to tell me which elements in my vector that satisfy my condition..."
- "...there was a function to calculate minima pointwise..."

Similarly, "How do I turn a data frame into a tibble?"

# Tidy data

# Tidy data

![](../images/tidydata-excerpt.png){width=350px}

- You should avoid doing operations across rows
- You will be given data with variables in rows

# Messy data

```{r}
pcr <- read_csv("pcr.csv")
```


# Messy data

\footnotesize
```{r}
pcr
```


# Tidy-ing messy data

```{r}
pcr %>%
  gather(key = taxon,
         value = total,
         -SampleID)
```

- `key` = new name of column variables
- `value` = new name of information column

# gather

Tidying your data can be annoying...

Amy's hot tip: avoid naming your new columns with the same names as old

```{r}
pcr %>%
  gather(key = SampleID,
         value = Taxon,
         -SampleID) # GAH
```

# Other options

- spread is the inverse of gather
- Good alternatives that I don't use: `reshape2` package and its functions `melt`, `dcast`, `acast`

# Putting it all together

```{r}
pcr %>%
  gather(key = taxon,
         value = total,
         -SampleID) %>%
  group_by(SampleID) %>%
  summarise(n_reads = sum(total))
```

# Integrating data

One of your homework questions will involve joining together data from multiple sources. 

- `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join`...

Check out [https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html)

# There is probably an easier way!

An extremely helpful index:

Hot tip: Learn how abstract what you're doing so you can better find help on the internet! 

- Googling "r tibble sort" brings me to the help page for `arrange`
